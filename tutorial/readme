We provide tutorials on four ways to integrate spatial omics:
1. Mosaic integration of spatial omics data for omics matching.
2. Mosaic integration of spatially mismatched omics data and missing omics imputation.
3. Vertical integration of spatial omics data.
4. Horizontal integration of spatial omics data.
